Generates a source table for Bilingual MMN
paradigm. All is based on several papers from:

Szychowska, M. (Ed.). (2016). Effects of sound pressure 
level and visual perceptual load on the auditory mismatch 
negativity. Neuroscience letters, 640(2017), 37-41.

Wiens, S. (Ed.). (2017). Data on the auditory duration 
mismatch negativity for different sound pressure levels 
and visual perceptual loads. Data in brief, 11(2017), 159-164.
